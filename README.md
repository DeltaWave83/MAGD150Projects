# MAGD150Projects
A place to put my 2023 MAGD150 projects
Assignment 7 features a set of randomized water droplets along with a rotating sun. The sun is going the wrong way though...is it in another planet?
Assignment 8 uses several imported images as well as the sound library to imatate a Skyrim meme. Do you dare touch the beacon?
Assignment 10 utilizes the animS library, animating a smiley face and some text. I was going to make a frown if you clicked the screen too early, but I didn't figure it out in time.
Thanks for checking this page out!
